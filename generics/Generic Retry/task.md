# Generic Retry

Refactor the function from the _Retry With Count_ exercise, in the _functions_ lesson to be able to handle any type, not
just `Accounts`. The only restriction should be that the return type of the retry function should be the same as the
return type of the function it's receiving as parameter.

Have a look at `main` function for example usages.
