# Fraction Simplifying

Reduce the fraction to it's lowest form when constructing `Fraction` instances.

<div class="hint">
In the `init` blocks both the properties and the constructor params are in scope. Use <code>this.</code> to access the properties (e.g. <code>this.numerator = numerator)</code>.
